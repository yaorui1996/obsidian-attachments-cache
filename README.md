## Summary

This plugin for Obsidian, stores remote attachments (currently only images) locally inside the vault.

The note is not modified by default, this way even outside of the vault the attachments keep working with the remotes URL.

> _Note:_ The attachments can be _"archived"_ instead, which makes the note reference the local file, check [`Update attachment link?`](./docs/settings.md#cacherule-update-attachment-link).

When the attachment is rendered in a note, the local version is used instead of the remote working as a local cache.

> _Note:_ The cached attachments can be deleted any time to free up disk space.

In detail, during the Obsidian render process, when an `img` is found:

1. The plugin checks if the image is cached/should be cached.
2. Download the image into a vault folder if is not cached.
3. Modify the `img` element to use the cached file inside the vault.

## Features

## Notes

The plugin is not on active development, new features or changes are developed when there is an oportunity. But issues and bugs will have especial priority.

### Thrid-party Integration

An API `AttachmentsCache` is exposed globally for easy integration.

For usage inside a plugin the methods `isPluginEnabled` and `getAPI` are exposed from an npm package named `@luis.bs/obsidian-attachments-cache`

```sh
pnpm add @luis.bs/obsidian-attachments-cache
```

On other environments where the package can not be used as a dependency, the API is attach to the global `window` object. The next declare can be used for development:

```ts
declare namespace AttachmentsCache {
    /** Determine whether the attachment matches a **short-term** storage rule. */
    isCacheable(remote: string, notepath: string, frontmatter?: unknown): boolean
    /** Determine whether the attachment matches a **long-term** storage rule. */
    isArchivable(remote: string, notepath: string, frontmatter?: unknown): boolean
    /** Download the attachment and get the localpath. */
    cache(remote: string, notepath: string, frontmatter?: unknown): Promise<string | undefined>
    /** Download the attachment, update the reference on the note and get the localpath. */
    archive(remote: string, notepath: string, frontmatter?: unknown): Promise<string | undefined>
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### An image rendered by another plugin is not been cached?

Plugins use [Markdown post processing](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Editor/Markdown+post+processing) to change the rendered view of the note.

By default any image rendered by a plugin may be cached, dependening on the [Cache priority](./docs/settings.md#cache-priority).

But if the plugin uses _**async functions**_ the order defined by **Cache priority** is not enforced, in that situations this plugin runs before the thrid-party plugin has ended and the added images avoid been cached.

To prevent that situation on `'NORMAL'` priority 2 second is awaited before the cache is executed.
On `'HIGHER'` priority 10 seconds are awaited.
